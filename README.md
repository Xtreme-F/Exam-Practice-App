# Exam-Practice-App
Java GUI application that helps memorize and practice for simple exams. Allows user to ***create*** new exams (and stores them), open and ***edit*** them, and ***practice*** them in different settings. Additionally, it calculates the score, allows user to choose to ***self-grade*** (User grades their questions) or ***autograde*** (App automatically grades the questions), and counts the number of correct, wrong and time for each question for the user to enhance the users' practice performance improvement. For Windows, it also offers ***text-to-speech*** during exam through Windows PowerShell that will run in the background according to exam settings (and will close properly when concluded).
